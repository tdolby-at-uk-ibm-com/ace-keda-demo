# Tekton builds of pre-req images

Used to build minimal ACE images that can then be used to build and run ACE applications
that use IBM MQ client capabilities.

![Image build overview](ace-demo-pipeline-tekton-2.png)

These images are not required for the successful use of the demo pipeline in all 
cases, as the `ace-server-prod` image can be used as a runtime image for CP4i users.

The minimal images can be helpful in some cases:

- For users who do not have an IBM Entitlement Key and therefore cannot use the 
  `ace-server-prod` image, `ace-minimal` can be built from the freely-available ACE 
  Developer edition and used to experiment with ACE and KEDA.
- In some cases, the container builds using buildah or Kaniko are unable to cache
  container images locally, leading to delays in unpacking the images every time.
  For these situations, `ace-minimal` is faster due to the small image size.

## Getting started

Many of the artifacts in this repo (such as ace-minimal-build-image-pipeline-run.yaml) will need to be 
customized depending on the exact cluster layout. The defaults are set up for Minikube running with Docker
on Ubuntu, and may need to be modified depending on network addresses, etc. The most-commonly-modified 
files have options in the comments, with [ace-minimal-image-pipeline-run.yaml](ace-minimal-image-pipeline-run.yaml)
being one example:
```
    - name: dockerRegistry
      # OpenShift
      #value: "image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc.cluster.local:5000/default"
      #value: "quay.io/trevor_dolby"
      #value: "us.icr.io/ace-containers"
      #value: "aceDemoRegistry.azurecr.io"
      # Minikube
      value: "192.168.49.2:5000/default"
```

The Tekton pipeline expects docker credentials to be provided for Kaniko to use when pushing the built image, and 
these credentials must be associated with the service account for the pipeline. If this has not already been done 
elsewhere, then create them with the following format for single-node OpenShift using temporary admin credentials
```
kubectl create secret docker-registry regcred --docker-server=image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc.cluster.local:5000 --docker-username=kubeadmin --docker-password=$(oc whoami -t)
kubectl apply -f tekton/service-account.yaml
```
or a dummy variant for Minikube without registry authentication enabled:
```
kubectl create secret docker-registry regcred --docker-server=us.icr.io --docker-username=dummy --docker-password=dummy
kubectl apply -f tekton/service-account.yaml
```
The service account also has the ability to create services, deployments, etc, which are necessary for running the service. 
Note that on Windows, kubectl sometimes complains about not being able to validate files (using --validate=false appears to 
eliminate the issue without causing problems) and seems to need the `--docker-email` parameter also, but the value can be anything.

## Setting the correct product version

The aceDownloadUrl value in ace-minimal-image-pipeline-run.yaml is likely to need updating, either to another version
in the same server directory (if available) or else to an ACE developer edition URL from the IBM website. In the latter
case, start at https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/app-connect/13.0?topic=enterprise-download-ace-developer-edition-get-started
and proceed through the pages until the main download page with a link: 

![download page](ace-dev-edition-download.png)

The link is likely to be of the form
```
https://iwm.dhe.ibm.com/sdfdl/v2/regs2/mbford/Xa.2/Xb.WJL1cUPI9gANEhP8GuPD_qX1rj6x5R4yTUM7s_C2ue8/Xc.13.0.1.0-ACE-LINUX64-DEVELOPER.tar.gz/Xd./Xf.LpR.D1vk/Xg.12164875/Xi.swg-wmbfd/XY.regsrvs/XZ.pPVETUejcqPsVfDVKbdNu6IRpo4TkyKu/13.0.1.0-ACE-LINUX64-DEVELOPER.tar.gz
```
Copy that link into the aceDownloadUrl parameter, adjusting the version numbers in the other files as needed.

## Running the pipeline

Setting up the pipeline requires Tekton to be installed (which may already have happend via OpenShift operators, in which case
skip the first line), tasks to be created, and the pipeline itself to be configured. The following commands build the ace-minimal
image and push it to the registry:
```
kubectl apply -f https://storage.googleapis.com/tekton-releases/pipeline/latest/release.yaml
kubectl apply -f tekton/minimal-image-build/03-ace-mqclient-image-build-and-push-task.yaml
kubectl apply -f tekton/minimal-image-build/ace-minimal-image-pipeline.yaml
kubectl create -f tekton/minimal-image-build/ace-minimal-image-pipeline-run.yaml
tkn pipelinerun logs -L -f
```

## OpenShift

The majority of steps are the same, but the registry authentication is a little different; assuming a session logged in as kubeadmin, it would look as follows:
```
kubectl create secret docker-registry regcred --docker-server=image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc.cluster.local:5000 --docker-username=kubeadmin --docker-password=$(oc whoami -t)
```
Note that the actual password itself (as opposed to the hash provided by "oc whoami -t") does not work for
registry authentication for some reason when using single-node OpenShift with a temporary admin user.

After that, the pipeline run files need to be adjusted to use the OpenShift registry, such 
as [ace-minimal-image-pipeline-run.yaml](ace-minimal-image-pipeline-run.yaml):
```
    - name: dockerRegistry
      # OpenShift
      value: "image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc.cluster.local:5000/default"
      #value: "quay.io/trevor_dolby"
      #value: "us.icr.io/ace-containers"
      #value: "aceDemoRegistry.azurecr.io"
      # Minikube
      #value: "192.168.49.2:5000/default"
```
and then the pipelines can be run as usual.
